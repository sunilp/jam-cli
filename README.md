## Why Jam?

Most AI coding tools are built around a single vendor's model, require a browser or IDE plugin, and send your code to a remote server you don't control.

**Jam is different by design:**

- It runs **entirely on your machine** by default — your code never leaves your filesystem
- It is **not tied to any single model or provider** — you choose the engine; Jam is the harness
- It behaves like a proper **Unix tool** — pipeable, composable, and scriptable
- It treats **code modification as a transaction** — validate first, preview always, confirm before applying
- It is **built to be contributed to** — clean TypeScript, well-tested, architecture documented below

---

## Highlights

| | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| ⚡ | **Streaming output** | Responses begin rendering on the first token |
| 💬 | **Interactive chat** | Multi-turn sessions with history and resume |
| 📂 | **Repo-aware** | Explain files, search code, review diffs with full workspace context |
| 🔍 | **Call graph tracing** | `jam trace` maps any symbol's callers, callees, imports, and upstream chain with Mermaid diagrams |
| 🩹 | **Patch workflow** | Generate unified diffs, validate, preview, and apply with confirmation |
| 🤖 | **Structured agent** | `jam run` uses a typed plan-then-execute loop with read-before-write safety and shrinkage guards |
| 🎫 | **Jira integration** | Browse assigned issues, auto-create branches, generate implementation plans |
| ✅ | **Verification pipeline** | `jam verify` scans for secrets, runs checks, and assesses risk before you ship |
| 📝 | **Smart commits** | Auto-detects your project's commit convention (Conventional Commits, JIRA prefixes, etc.) |
| 🔌 | **5 providers** | Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Embedded — adapter pattern for adding any LLM |
| 🧠 | **Auto-detection** | `--model claude-sonnet-4-20250514` auto-selects the right provider — no `--provider` needed |
| 💾 | **Response caching** | Identical prompts return cached results instantly — saves API calls and money |
| 📦 | **Embedded inference** | **[Experimental]** Tiny GGUF model runs directly in-process via `node-llama-cpp` |
| ⚙️ | **Layered config** | Global → repo → CLI flags; multiple named profiles |
| 🔐 | **Secure secrets** | OS keychain via keytar, env var fallback |
| 🐚 | **Shell completions** | Bash and Zsh |
| 🏠 | **Privacy-first** | Runs locally — your code never leaves your machine |

---

## Design Philosophy

> The best developer tools disappear into your workflow. They don't ask you to change how you work — they work the way you already do.

**You own the model.** Jam's `ProviderAdapter` is a clean interface — swap the AI engine with a config change, not a rewrite. No vendor lock-in, no model loyalty.

**Your code stays private.** The default is `localhost`. Nothing leaves your machine unless you explicitly point Jam at a remote provider. This isn't just a feature — it's the architecture.

**Changes are transactions, not actions.** `jam patch` validates with `git apply --check` before anything is touched, shows a full preview, and waits for explicit confirmation. No "undo" needed — changes never happen without your approval.

**Unix composability.** `jam ask` reads stdin, writes stdout, supports `--json`. It's a pipe stage, not a walled garden.

**Security is configuration, not hope.** Tool permissions (`toolPolicy`), allowed operations (`toolAllowlist`), and log redaction (`redactPatterns`) are declarative config — committable to `.jamrc` so your whole team inherits the same guardrails.

---

## Who Is Jam For?

| Situation | Why Jam fits |
|-----------|-------------|
| You work in a **security-sensitive codebase** | Local-only by default — nothing leaves your machine |
| You want to **use different models** for different tasks | Named profiles + provider adapter — switch with `--profile` |
| You live in the **terminal** and resent leaving it | Every command is designed for the shell, not a browser tab |
| You're on a **corporate network** that blocks AI services | Point `baseUrl` at an internal Ollama instance and you're done |
| You want an AI tool that fits into **CI/CD scripts** | `--json` output, stdin support, non-zero exit codes on errors |
| You want to **contribute to an AI tool** without fighting vendor APIs | The hard parts (streaming, tool-calling, config) are already built cleanly |

---

## Quick Start

### Provider Support

| Provider | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Ollama** | ✅ Default | Local inference via `ollama serve` |
| **OpenAI** | ✅ Supported | Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| **Anthropic** | ✅ Supported | Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; Claude models with tool calling |
| **Groq** | ✅ Supported | Requires `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| **Embedded** | ⚗️ Experimental | In-process via `node-llama-cpp`, no server needed |

**Provider auto-detection:** You don't need to specify `--provider` if you pass a model name. Jam infers the provider automatically:

```bash
jam ask "Hello" --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514    # → anthropic
jam ask "Hello" --model gpt-4o                  # → openai
jam ask "Hello" --model llama-3.1-8b-instant    # → groq
```

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **One of the following model backends:**
  - **[Ollama](https://ollama.ai)** running locally (`ollama serve`) + a pulled model (`ollama pull llama3.2`)
  - **Embedded mode** — no server needed! Uses `node-llama-cpp` to run a tiny GGUF model in-process.
    Install with: `npm install node-llama-cpp` (auto-downloads a ~250 MB model on first run)

### Install

```bash
# Try instantly — no install required
npx @sunilp-org/jam-cli doctor

# Global install from npm
npm install -g @sunilp-org/jam-cli

# Homebrew (macOS / Linux)
brew tap sunilp/tap
brew install jam-cli

# Or run from source
git clone https://github.com/sunilp/jam-cli.git
cd jam-cli
npm install
npm run build
npm link          # makes `jam` available globally
```

### First Run

```bash
jam init          # interactive setup — detects providers, creates .jamrc + JAM.md
jam doctor        # checks Node version, config, provider connectivity, ripgrep
jam auth login    # validates connection to the configured provider
```

---

## Commands

### `jam init`

Interactive onboarding wizard. Detects available providers (Ollama running? API keys set?), lets you choose, creates `.jamrc` and `JAM.md`, and verifies connectivity.

```bash
jam init              # interactive provider selection + config creation
jam init --yes        # auto-select the best available provider
```

---

### `jam ask`

One-shot question. Streams the response to stdout.

```bash
jam ask "What is the difference between TCP and UDP?"

# From stdin
echo "Explain recursion in one paragraph" | jam ask

# From a file
jam ask --file prompt.txt

# JSON output (full response + token usage)
jam ask "What is 2+2?" --json

# Override model (provider auto-detected)
jam ask "Hello" --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Use a named profile
jam ask "Hello" --profile work
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--file <path>` | Read prompt from file |
| `--system <prompt>` | Override system prompt |
| `--json` | Machine-readable JSON output |
| `--model <id>` | Override model for this request |
| `--provider <name>` | Override provider |
| `--base-url <url>` | Override provider base URL |
| `--profile <name>` | Use a named config profile |
| `--no-tools` | Disable read-only tool use (file discovery) |
| `--no-color` | Strip ANSI colors from output (global flag) |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress all non-essential output (spinners, status lines, decorations) |

---

### `jam chat`

Interactive multi-turn chat REPL (Ink/React TUI).

```bash
jam chat                         # new session
jam chat --name "auth refactor"  # named session
jam chat --resume <sessionId>    # resume a previous session
```

**Keyboard shortcuts inside chat:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Submit message |
| `Ctrl-C` (once) | Interrupt current generation |
| `Ctrl-C` (twice) | Exit chat |

Sessions are saved automatically to `~/.local/share/jam/sessions/` (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/jam/sessions/`).

---

### `jam trace`

Trace the complete call graph of any function, class, or symbol across the codebase. Shows definition, callers, callees, import chain, upstream caller hierarchy, and a Mermaid diagram — all by default.

```bash
jam trace createProvider                # full trace with AI analysis + Mermaid diagram
jam trace JamError --depth 1            # shallow upstream chain
jam trace loadConfig --no-ai            # skip AI, just show the graph
jam trace buildCallGraph --json         # structured JSON output
```

**Example output:**

```

  AI Analysis
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  **Flow Summary:** createProvider is the central factory for LLM adapters...
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--depth <n>` | Upstream chain depth (default: 3) |
| `--no-ai` | Skip AI analysis, show only the graph |
| `--json` | Output the raw call graph as JSON |

---

### `jam explain`

Read one or more files and ask the model to explain them.

```bash
jam explain src/auth/middleware.ts
jam explain src/api/routes.ts src/api/handlers.ts
jam explain src/utils/retry.ts --json
```

---

### `jam search`

Search the codebase using ripgrep (falls back to JS if `rg` is not installed).

```bash
jam search "TODO"                          # plain search, prints results
jam search "useEffect" --glob "*.tsx"      # filter by file type
jam search "createServer" --ask            # pipe results to AI for explanation
jam search "error handling" --max-results 50
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--glob <pattern>` | Limit to files matching this glob (e.g. `*.ts`) |
| `--max-results <n>` | Max results (default: 20) |
| `--ask` | Send results to AI for analysis |
| `--json` | JSON output (with `--ask`) |

---

### `jam diff`

Run `git diff` and optionally review it with AI.

```bash
jam diff                    # review working tree changes
jam diff --staged           # review staged changes (ready to commit)
jam diff --path src/api/    # limit to a specific directory
jam diff --no-review        # just print the raw diff, no AI
jam diff --staged --json    # JSON output
```

---

### `jam review`

Review a branch or pull request with AI.

```bash
jam review                        # review current branch against main
jam review --base develop         # diff against a different base branch
jam review --pr 42                # review a specific PR (requires GitHub CLI)
jam review --json                 # JSON output
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--base <ref>` | Base branch or ref to diff against (default: `main`) |
| `--pr <number>` | Review a specific PR number (requires `gh` CLI) |
| `--json` | Machine-readable JSON output |

---

### `jam commit`

Generate an AI-written commit message from staged changes and commit. Jam auto-detects your project's commit convention from git history — Conventional Commits, JIRA prefixes (`PROJ-123: ...`), bracket tickets (`[PROJ-123] ...`), or any consistent pattern.

```bash
jam commit                 # generate message, confirm, then commit
jam commit --dry           # generate message only, do not commit
jam commit --yes           # skip confirmation prompt
jam commit --amend         # amend the last commit with a new AI message
```

**Convention detection:**

Jam samples the last 20 commits and detects the dominant pattern:

```
Detected convention: {ticket}: {type}({scope}): {description}
Generating commit message...

  PROJ-456: feat(auth): add OAuth2 token refresh
```

You can also configure conventions explicitly in `.jamrc`:

```json
{
  "commitConvention": {
    "format": "{ticket}: {type}: {description}",
    "ticketPattern": "PROJ-\\d+",
    "ticketRequired": true,
    "types": ["feat", "fix", "chore", "docs"],
    "rules": ["Always reference the module name in scope"]
  }
}
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry` | Generate the message but do not commit |
| `--yes` | Auto-confirm without prompting |
| `--amend` | Amend the last commit with a new AI-generated message |

---

### `jam verify`

Validation pipeline for changes. Runs checks, scans for secrets, and assesses risk before you ship.

```bash
jam verify                          # verify current working tree changes
jam verify --staged                 # verify only staged changes
jam verify --base main              # diff against a base branch
jam verify --json                   # structured JSON report
jam verify --fail-on-risk high      # exit 1 if risk >= high (for CI)
jam verify --no-ai                  # skip AI risk assessment
```

**Checks run:**

| Check | Weight | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Diff sanity | — | Verifies changes exist and aren't too large |
| Secret scan | 0.4 | 10 patterns: API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, connection strings |
| Typecheck | 0.2 | Runs `tsc --noEmit` (if tsconfig exists) |
| Lint | 0.1 | Runs the project's lint command |
| Tests | 0.25 | Runs the project's test suite |
| AI risk review | — | LLM analyzes the diff for security, logic, and quality issues |

**Risk levels:** `low` → `medium` → `high` → `critical`, computed from weighted check failures.

---

### `jam patch`

Ask the AI to generate a unified diff patch, validate it, and optionally apply it.

```bash
jam patch "Add input validation to the login function"
jam patch "Fix the off-by-one error in pagination" --file src/api/paginate.ts
jam patch "Add JSDoc comments to all public methods" --dry   # generate only, don't apply
jam patch "Remove unused imports" --yes                      # auto-confirm apply
```

**Flow:**
1. Collects context (git status, current diff, specified files)
2. Prompts the model for a unified diff
3. Validates with `git apply --check`
4. Shows the patch preview
5. Asks for confirmation (unless `--yes`)
6. Applies with `git apply`

---

### `jam run`

Agentic task workflow using a **structured plan-then-execute** loop. The model first generates a typed `ExecutionPlan` with ordered steps and success criteria, then executes each step with full safety enforcement.

```bash
jam run "Find all TODO comments and summarize them"
jam run "Check git status and explain what's changed"
jam run "Read src/config.ts and identify any security issues"
jam run "Add input validation to the login handler"   # involves writes
jam run --yes "Rename all occurrences of userId to accountId"  # auto-approve writes
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--yes` | Auto-approve all write tool confirmations (non-interactive) |
| `--model <id>` | Override model for this task |
| `--provider <name>` | Override provider |
| `--profile <name>` | Use a named config profile |

**How it works:**

1. **Plan** — model generates an ordered list of steps (read → understand → write) with explicit success criteria
2. **Execute** — each step runs in sequence; read-only results are cached to avoid redundant calls
3. **Read-before-write gate** — write tools are automatically blocked until the target file has been read first, preventing silent overwrites of unread files
4. **Shrinkage guard** — if a `write_file` produces a file suspiciously smaller than the original, the write is auto-reverted and the model is redirected
5. **Critic pass** — after the loop completes, a critic evaluates the result and injects a correction if quality is insufficient

**Available tools (model-callable):**

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `read_file` | Read | Read file contents |
| `list_dir` | Read | List directory contents |
| `search_text` | Read | Search codebase with ripgrep |
| `git_status` | Read | Get git status |
| `git_diff` | Read | Get git diff |
| `write_file` | **Write** | Write to a file (prompts for confirmation) |
| `apply_patch` | **Write** | Apply a unified diff (prompts for confirmation) |
| `run_command` | **Write** | Execute a shell command (dangerous patterns blocked; prompts for confirmation) |

Write tools require confirmation unless `toolPolicy` is set to `always` or `allowlist` in config.

---

### `jam jira`

Connect to Jira (Cloud or on-prem Server/Data Center), browse assigned issues, and start working with AI-generated implementation plans.

```bash
jam jira issues                           # list issues assigned to you
jam jira issues --status "In Progress"    # filter by status
jam jira issues --json                    # JSON output
jam jira view PROJ-123                    # view full issue details
jam jira view PROJ-123 --json             # JSON output
jam jira start PROJ-123                   # fetch issue, create branch, generate plan
jam jira start PROJ-123 --no-branch       # skip branch creation
```

**`jam jira start` flow:**

1. Fetches full issue details (description, subtasks, comments)
2. Creates a git branch from the issue key and summary (e.g. `proj-123-add-user-authentication`)
3. Generates an AI implementation plan: summary, key files, steps, testing, edge cases
4. Suggests the next step: `jam run "Implement PROJ-123: ..."`

**Configuration** (in `.jamrc`):

```json
{
  "jira": {
    "baseUrl": "https://jira.company.com",
    "email": "you@company.com",
    "branchTemplate": "{type}/{key}-{summary}",
    "defaultJql": "project = MYPROJ"
  }
}
```

Set your token: `export JIRA_API_TOKEN=<your-token>` (or `apiToken` in config).

Branch templates support `{key}`, `{type}` (mapped: Bug→fix, Story→feat, Task→chore), and `{summary}`.

---

### `jam cache`

Manage the response cache. Identical prompts return cached results instantly, saving API calls.

```bash
jam cache stats            # show entry count, size, TTL, age range
jam cache stats --json     # structured JSON
jam cache clear            # delete all cached responses
jam cache prune            # remove only expired entries
```

Caching is enabled by default with a 1-hour TTL. Configure in `.jamrc`:

```json
{
  "cacheEnabled": true,
  "cacheTtlSeconds": 3600
}
```

---

### `jam auth`

```bash
jam auth login    # validate connectivity to the current provider
jam auth logout   # remove stored credentials from keychain
```

---

### `jam config`

```bash
jam config show            # print merged effective config as JSON
jam config init            # create .jam/config.json in the current directory
jam config init --global   # create ~/.config/jam/config.json
```

---

### `jam context`

Manage the `JAM.md` project context file. This file is auto-read by `jam ask` and `jam chat` to give the model awareness of your project's architecture, conventions, and goals.

```bash
jam context init           # generate JAM.md at the workspace root
jam context init --force   # overwrite an existing JAM.md
jam context show           # display the current JAM.md contents
```

---

### `jam models list`

```bash
jam models list            # list models available from the current provider
jam models list --provider ollama --base-url http://localhost:11434
```

---

### `jam history`

```bash
jam history list           # list all saved chat sessions
jam history show <id>      # show all messages in a session (first 8 chars of ID work)
```

---

### `jam completion install`

```bash
jam completion install                    # auto-detects shell
jam completion install --shell bash       # bash completion script
jam completion install --shell zsh        # zsh completion script
```

Follow the printed instructions to add the completion to your shell.

---

### `jam doctor`

Run system diagnostics:

```bash
jam doctor
```

Checks:
- Node.js version (>= 20)
- Config file is valid
- Provider connectivity (Ollama reachable)
- ripgrep availability (optional, JS fallback used if absent)
- keytar availability (optional, env vars used if absent)

---

## Configuration

### Config File Locations

Jam merges config in priority order (highest wins):

```
1. CLI flags                              (--provider, --model, etc.)
2. .jam/config.json  or  .jamrc           (repo-level)
3. ~/.jam/config.json                     (user home-dir dotfile — preferred)
4. ~/.config/jam/config.json              (XDG user config — fallback)
5. Built-in defaults
```

> **Recommended:** Use `~/.jam/config.json` for your personal settings (provider, API keys, default model).
> Use `.jam/config.json` at the repo root for project-specific overrides (tool policy, redact patterns).

jam init

# Or manual config creation:
jam config init --global   # creates ~/.config/jam/config.json
jam config init            # creates .jam/config.json (repo-level)
```

### Using Profiles

```bash
# Use a specific profile
jam ask "Hello" --profile cloud

# Or auto-detect from model name
jam ask "Hello" --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514    # auto-selects anthropic provider

## Embedded Provider — Experimental

> **EXPERIMENTAL** — The embedded provider is functional but quality is limited by small model sizes. For production workloads, use Ollama or OpenAI.

The `embedded` provider runs a tiny GGUF model **directly in-process** via [`node-llama-cpp`](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp). No Ollama installation, no server process, no network calls. **Models are only downloaded when you explicitly set `provider: "embedded"`** — it never downloads anything unless you opt in.

### Setup

```bash
# Install the native dependency (optional — only needed for embedded mode)
npm install node-llama-cpp

# Switch to embedded provider
jam ask "Hello" --provider embedded

# Or set it permanently in your config
jam config init --global   # then edit ~/.jam/config.json
```

### How It Works

1. On first use, Jam auto-downloads a small model (~250 MB) to `~/.jam/models/`
2. The model loads in-process using llama.cpp bindings — no external server
3. Streaming, tool-calling, and all standard commands work as usual

### Available Models

| Alias | Size (Q4_K_M) | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| `smollm2-135m` | ~100 MB | Ultra-light, very fast, basic quality |
| `smollm2-360m` | ~250 MB | **Default** — good quality-to-size ratio |
| `smollm2-1.7b` | ~1 GB | Best quality for embedded, needs more RAM |

```bash
# Use a specific embedded model alias
jam ask "Explain git rebase" --provider embedded --model smollm2-1.7b

# Or point to any local GGUF file
jam ask "Hello" --provider embedded --model /path/to/custom-model.gguf
```

### When to Use Embedded vs Ollama

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| No Ollama / can't install system software | **Embedded** |
| CI/CD pipeline, Docker container, SSH box | **Embedded** |
| Air-gapped / offline machine | **Embedded** (after initial model download) |
| Want best quality & larger models (7B+) | **Ollama** |
| GPU acceleration needed | **Ollama** |
| Already have Ollama running | **Ollama** |

## Development

```bash
npm run dev -- ask "What is 2+2?"   # run from source with tsx
npm run build                         # compile TypeScript to dist/
npm run typecheck                     # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint                          # ESLint
npm test                              # Vitest unit tests (289 tests)
npm run test:watch                    # watch mode
npm run test:coverage                 # coverage report
```

## Adding a New Provider

1. Implement `ProviderAdapter` from `src/providers/base.ts`:

```typescript
import type { ProviderAdapter, ProviderInfo, CompletionRequest, StreamChunk } from './base.js';

export class MyProvider implements ProviderAdapter {
  readonly info: ProviderInfo = { name: 'myprovider', supportsStreaming: true };

  async validateCredentials(): Promise<void> { /* ... */ }
  async listModels(): Promise<string[]> { /* ... */ }
  async *streamCompletion(request: CompletionRequest): AsyncIterable<StreamChunk> { /* ... */ }
}
```

2. Register in `src/providers/factory.ts`:

```typescript
if (provider === 'myprovider') {
  const { MyProvider } = await import('./myprovider.js');
  return new MyProvider({ apiKey: profile.apiKey });
}
```

3. (Optional) Add auto-detection in `inferProviderFromModel()`:

```typescript
if (m.startsWith('my-model-')) return 'myprovider';
```

4. Use: `jam ask "Hello" --provider myprovider`

## Contributing

Jam is intentionally built to be easy to extend. The architecture is layered, each concern is isolated, and the three main contribution surfaces — providers, tools, and commands — each have a clean interface to implement.

**You don't need to understand the whole codebase to contribute.** A new provider is one file. A new tool is one file. The patterns are already established and documented.

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** your feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing-feature`)
3. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
4. **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feat/amazing-feature`)
5. **Open** a Pull Request

Please read our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct, development workflow, and pull request process.

### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/sunilp/jam-cli/labels/good%20first%20issue) — these are great starting points for new contributors.

### What the Codebase Looks Like

- **Strict TypeScript throughout** — no `any`, no guessing what a function does
- **Tests colocated with source** — `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts`, using Vitest (289 tests across 23 files)
- **One file per concern** — each command, provider, and tool is self-contained
- **Zod schema validation** — config is validated at load time, not at runtime when it's too late
- **Conventional Commits** — the git log tells the story of the project

If you can read TypeScript, you can contribute to Jam.

## Probable Enhancements

> Ideas and directions under consideration. These range from quick wins to deep architectural changes. Contributions, RFCs, and discussion on any of these are welcome.

### Plugin System

The tool registry (`ToolRegistry.register()`) already accepts any `ToolDefinition`, but tool discovery is hardcoded. A proper plugin system would allow external tools without modifying source.

- **Local plugins** — load `ToolDefinition` modules from `.jam/plugins/` or `~/.config/jam/plugins/`
- **npm plugin packages** — `jam plugin install @scope/jam-plugin-docker` discovers and registers tools at startup
- **Plugin manifest** — declarative `jam-plugin.json` with name, version, tool definitions, required permissions
- **Sandboxed execution** — plugins run with restricted filesystem/network access based on declared capabilities

### Skills

Skills are named, composable mini-agents — each with a focused system prompt, a curated tool subset, and a defined output contract.

- **Built-in skills** — `refactor`, `test-writer`, `documenter`, `security-audit`
- **User-defined skills** — `.jam/skills/` directory with YAML/JSON skill definitions
- **Composable** — skills can call other skills (e.g., `refactor` invokes `test-writer` to verify changes)

### Sub-Agents & Task Decomposition

`jam run` uses a structured plan-then-execute loop. The next evolution is true sub-agent decomposition — routing specialist child agents for independent sub-tasks.

- **Planner agent** — breaks a complex instruction into an ordered DAG of sub-tasks
- **Parallel sub-agents** — independent sub-tasks execute concurrently
- **Fail-and-retry isolation** — a failed sub-agent can be retried without restarting the entire task

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. Adding MCP client support would let Jam consume any MCP-compatible server.

### Embeddings & Vector Search

The current past-session search uses keyword overlap (Jaccard scoring). Optional local embeddings would enable true semantic search.

- **Local embedding model** — use Ollama's embedding endpoint so nothing leaves your machine
- **Semantic code search** — `jam search "authentication flow"` returns semantically relevant code
- **RAG pipeline** — retrieve relevant code chunks before prompting

### Cost & Token Tracking

`TokenUsage` is already captured per request but not aggregated or displayed.

- **Session cost estimation** — estimate cost based on provider pricing
- **Budget limits** — `maxCostPerSession`, `maxCostPerDay` in config
- **Usage dashboard** — `jam usage` command showing tokens consumed over time
